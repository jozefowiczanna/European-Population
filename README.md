#European Population App

The goal of this app is to get population data from World Bank API and present it in two ways:
- on interactive SVG map - map changes color depending on data - you can hover mouse (on smaller screen click) to show tooltip with information regarding specific country
- inside table - data can be sorted in four categories, ascending or descending
